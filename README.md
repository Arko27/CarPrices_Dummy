# CarPrices_Dummy
Here I have made a Linear Regression Model for the dataset of Cars to predict the Price of a Car given certain parameters. The model is trained against **Car Model, Mileage and Age** of the Car.
The Linear Regression Model is taken from the ***sklearn.linear-model*** package of Python.
I have tested the Model for various inputs and the overall score of the Model is 94.17%.
